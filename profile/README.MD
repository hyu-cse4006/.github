ShoppingNova

**Shopping Nova** is a 3D online shopping mall where you can explore and shop for LG Electronics products in a space-themed environment. Here, shopping is not just about purchasing items but feels like embarking on an intergalactic journey.  

Set against the backdrop of the vast universe, each product is represented as a sparkling star, allowing users to freely navigate, rotate, and explore these stars. Just like traveling through a galaxy, you can discover various LG products and intuitively access detailed information about each one.  

This unique shopping experience transcends traditional online malls, offering customers a fresh and exciting way to explore LG Electronics' offerings. Dive into the infinite expanse of space, uncover hidden treasures, and enjoy a whole new approach to shopping!
